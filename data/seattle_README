seattle_identities.txt
Building permit IDs, one per line.

seattle_terms.txt
Terms in the vocabulary, one term per line.

seattle_tfidf.txt
Each line describes a building permit.
The first number is 1 if the permit is for single-family/duplex, 2 if this is for multifamily and 0 in all other cases.
Then pairs of the form index:value follow where index is the line number in seattle_terms.txt where the respective word of the description for the permit appears and value is the (sparse) vector entry for this after passing the set of descriptions to a TFIDF transformation. index:value pairs are separated by spaces.

seattle_locations.txt
Each line has longitude, latitude pairs separated by space (for each building permit)

seattle_values.txt
Value for each building permit

seattle_tfidf_csr_matrix.npz
TF-IDF matrix in CSR format

There is a room for improving on the stemming we applied :)
